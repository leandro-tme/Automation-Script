# The following yml file "throws a post hook" when the apply_vive_settings state comes as "False" during a scheduled job. 
# When it's false it tells the minion to run the automationscript in cmd to re-apply the state properly until it's returned as "True" ("Pseudocode from last week/Script we are working on right now").
