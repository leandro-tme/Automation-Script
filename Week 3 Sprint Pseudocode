Plan:
Use the filecmp library to do a deep comparison which allows us to find any mismatched files
The library shutil comes in handy for us to be able to copy the settings file whenever the mismatch happens as it indicates us that the headphones will not have the correct profile set which is why the program proceeds to copy the file in the directory we stated.
